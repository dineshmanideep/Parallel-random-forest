Notes:
1. Each page of report should have a header text (on the side): 
    NITK, Surathkal - Dept. of Information Technology - IT302
2. No actual C++ code, when pseudocode is required, make it very short
3. Whole report must fit in 4 pages ATMOST.
4. Be concise, straight to the point and not many buzz words.


Sections

# Introduction
Introduction 

# Methodology
1. Decision tree introduction, formula etc.
2. Random forests introduction, formula etc.
3. Custom data frame implementation, no external library approach, etc.
4. Tree level parallelization (very short pseudocode to show parallelism)
5. Random forest level parallelization (very short pseudocode to show parallelism)
6. Model performance metrics
7. Parallelism performance metrics (only speedup)

# Benchmark Results and Graphs 

## About Dataset
Dry beans prediction - predict type of bean based on some classifications
3848 samples
16 numerical features
categorical output feature

## Benchmarks
(each will have some text introducing why this results are important, then a graph image, then the results)
1. Speedup discussion between varying number of trees (with progress bar) (2, 10, 100, 200 trees)
2. Speedup discussion between varying number of samples (100, 500, 1500, 3500)
 - one graph fixed for 
3. Speedup discussion between showing progress bar and not (100 trees)
4. Accuracy discussion between single decision tree and random forest of 200 trees
