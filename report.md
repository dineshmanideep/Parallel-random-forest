Notes:
1. Each page of report should have a header text (on the side): 
    NITK, Surathkal - Dept. of Information Technology - IT302
2. No actual C++ code

## Sections

# Introduction
Introduction 

# Methodology
1. Decision tree introduction, formula etc.
2. Random forests introduction, formula etc.
3. Custom data frame implementation, no external library approach, etc.
4. Tree level parallelization (very short pseudocode to show parallelism)
5. Random forest level parallelization (very short pseudocode to show parallelism)
6. Model performance metrics
7. Parallelism performance metrics (only speedup)

# Benchmark Results and Graphs 
(each will have some text introducing why this results are important, then a graph image, then the results)
1. Speedup discussion between varying number of trees (with progress bar) (2, 10, 100, 200 trees)
2. Speedup discussion between varying number of samples (100, 500, 1500, 3500)
 - one graph fixed for 
3. Speedup discussion between showing progress bar and not (100 trees)
4. Accuracy discussion between single decision tree and random forest of 200 trees

# Conclusion
Ending notes and acknowledgements, google course etc.
